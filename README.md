This is repository of compilation files for VIA configurator. Only for [Jiran keyboard.](https://github.com/Ladniy/jiran-breakoff) 

Main JSON file, that you need for VIA configurator to work:
[Jiran Main File](https://github.com/Ladniy/VIA-Compilation/blob/master/Jiran%20Main%20File.json)

[My own Jiran layout]()

## How work with VIA

First of all you need to flash you Jiran keyboard with correct firmware version (use [QMK toolbox]()).

Flash this [HEX file]() if you got version with single color LEDs

Flash this [HEX file]() it you got version with RGB LEDs

After flashing you can start configure VIA:

* [Download VIA](https://github.com/the-via/releases/releases/tag/v1.3.1)
* [Download Main File](https://github.com/Ladniy/VIA-Compilation/blob/master/Jiran%20Main%20File.json)
* Open main file into VIA:

  * Open VIA
  * Open main file by hotkeys (Ctrl + O) or menu in right upper corner of VIA window

After all these actions you will see default Jiran layout:

Now you can configure your layout as you want.
