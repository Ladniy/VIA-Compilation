## How work with VIA

First of all you need to flash your Jiran keyboard with correct firmware version (use [QMK toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases)).

Flash this [HEX file](https://github.com/Ladniy/VIA-Compilation/blob/master/jiran_rev1_via.hex) if you got revision with single color LEDs

Flash this [HEX file](https://github.com/Ladniy/VIA-Compilation/blob/master/jiran_rev2_via.hex) it you got revision with RGB LEDs

After flashing you can start configure VIA:

* [Download VIA](https://github.com/the-via/releases/releases/tag/v1.3.1)
* [Download Main File](https://github.com/Ladniy/VIA-Compilation/blob/master/Jiran%20Main%20File.json)
* Open main file into VIA:

  * Open VIA
  * Open main file by hotkeys (Ctrl + O) or menu in right upper corner of VIA window

After all these actions you will see default Jiran layout:

Now you can configure your layout as you want.
